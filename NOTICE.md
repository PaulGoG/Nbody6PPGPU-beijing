# Notice

This repository is a fork of [nbody6ppgpu/Nbody6PPGPU-beijing](https://github.com/nbody6ppgpu/Nbody6PPGPU-beijing),
the NBODY6++GPU code maintained by Rainer Spurzem's group at ARI Heidelberg and KIAA, Peking University.
The branch `campaign` carries the corrections I apply for the simulation campaigns driven by
[Nbody6Dynamics.jl](https://github.com/PaulGoG/Nbody6Dynamics.jl), one commit per correction on top of the
upstream release v2026.07 (commit 618d7a4). The upstream branches are mirrored unchanged. Pull requests
upstream follow once the corrections have been validated in production.

## Credit

NBODY6++GPU is the work of Sverre Aarseth (NBODY6), Rainer Spurzem (NBODY6++), Long Wang (the GPU, SIMD and
MPI version), Keigo Nitadori (GPU kernels), the authors of the stellar-evolution routines (Jarrod Hurley,
Onno Pols, Christopher Tout; Sambaran Banerjee; Albrecht Kamlah and collaborators), and the contributors
recorded in the upstream history. Results obtained with this fork cite the upstream code papers:

## Licensing

The upstream repository carries no licence file. The earlier public repository of the same code,
[nbodyx/Nbody6ppGPU](https://github.com/nbodyx/Nbody6ppGPU), is distributed under the MIT licence
("Copyright (c) 2015 NBODY6++GPU development team", added on 2023-07-28). I treat the inherited code on
those terms, with the attribution above, until the upstream maintainers state terms of their own.

My modifications on the branch `campaign` (the commits after v2026.07) are released under the MIT licence:
